# üõ†Ô∏è Pulverizer Recipes

The **Basic Pulverizer** is an industrial machine that crushes blocks or materials into their dust or base forms. Some recipes also include a chance to **duplicate outputs**, rewarding extra dusts with bonus rolls.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è How It Works

- Insert one valid input item or tag (e.g. `#minecraft:coals`).
- The Pulverizer will process the item using energy.
- Outputs are placed into a single result slot.
- Some recipes have a chance to generate **bonus dust** during processing.
