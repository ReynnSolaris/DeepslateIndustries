# 🛠️ Machines

Welcome to the **Machines** section of Deepslate Industries. Here you'll find details about each machine's behavior, functionality, and integration with the mod's systems.

---

## 🔮 Amethyst Infuser

The **Amethyst Infuser** is a multi-block reactive machine that accelerates Amethyst cluster growth and harvest.

- 📐 **Setup**:
  - Place a **Block of Amethyst** exactly **3 blocks above** the Infuser.
  - This block will be transformed into **Budding Amethyst** once powered.
  - The Infuser must be **powered from the bottom** using energy pipes or generators.

- 🌟 **Function**:
  - Once the budding block is formed, a beam projects from the Infuser to empower it.
  - This **increases growth rate** of surrounding Amethyst Clusters to **2x–3x speed**.
  - When all adjacent clusters reach **maximum growth**, they are automatically converted into **Crystallized Amethyst**.

- 💡 Ideal for passive crystal farming and automation.

## 🧪 Amethyst Enhancer

The **Amethyst Enhancer** allows for mystical crafting and alchemy using **Crystallized Amethyst Dust** as fuel.

- 🔌 **Requires**: Crystallized Amethyst Dust
- ⚙️ **Slots**:
  - Input A (required)
  - Input B (optional)
  - Output

- 🧬 **Function**:
  - Transforms or upgrades items using recipes defined by the mod.
  - Supports single and dual-input crafting.

## ⚙️ Basic Pulverizer

The **Basic Pulverizer** processes items into dust form for further crafting or energy use.

- 🔄 **Input**:
  - Ores, crystals, or raw materials

- 🎯 **Output**:
  - Pulverized Dust (e.g., Crystallized Amethyst Dust)

- ⚡ **Requires power** to operate (RF compatible)

- ✅ Simple single-slot input/output interface.

---

## 🔥 Basic Generator

The **Basic Generator** provides a simple way to generate energy (RF) using standard fuel.

- 🔥 Accepts:
  - Any valid burnable item (coal, charcoal, etc.)

- ⚡ **Generates**:
  - Redstone Flux (RF), compatible with the pipe network

- 🧩 Best paired with energy pipes to power nearby machines.

---

## 📦 Pipe Compatibility

All machines support integration with:

- 🧱 **Item Pipes** – for input/output automation
- ⚡ **Energy Pipes** – for powering connected machines
- 💧 **Fluid Pipes** – WIP (to be supported in future fluid-based machines)
